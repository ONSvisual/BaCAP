# The source code for the svelte app 

## Lib 
This is where the libraries used lie. Each directory corresponds to a certain page 

** note some of these do not trigger automatic reloads and dev work related to the same path should be done in a routes directory with the same page**

## Routes
Where all the directions live. Currently there are two active pages:

- draw-new
- build-new

ignore all other files.
